# Pathfinding-Visualizer-Interactive-Algorithm-Simulation-Tool
Created an interactive visualizer that demonstrates how popular pathfinding algorithms identify the shortest route between two points on a grid. The tool allows users to place start/end nodes, draw obstacles, and observe algorithms like Dijkstra’s, A*, BFS, and DFS in action through smooth animations.
